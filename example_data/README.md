# Example Data

This folder contains minimal example datasets for reproducibility.

- input_polygons.gpkg  
  Sample local polygon layer used as input.

- api_snapshot.geojson  
  Static snapshot of the EPA WFD River Waterbodies dataset 
  used to avoid dependency on live API services.

These files allow the plugin workflow to be reproduced 
without requiring network access.
